# **RAG-based PDF Summarization and Question Answering System**

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that summarizes content and answers questions from multilingual PDFs. It handles both scanned and digital PDFs and can scale to large datasets. The pipeline features chat memory, query decomposition, hybrid search (keyword + semantic), reranking, metadata filtering, and optimized text extraction.

## **Features**

- **Multilingual Text Extraction**: Supports extraction from both scanned and digitally-created PDFs using OCR and standard parsing techniques.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword-based and semantic search to improve the relevance of retrieved documents.
- **Optimized Chunking**: Efficiently splits text into chunks to maintain context and ensure accurate embedding.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieves and generates responses based on relevant document chunks.
- **Chat Memory**: Maintains context over multiple queries.
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable sub-queries.
- **Metadata Filtering**: Filters documents based on language, document type, or metadata attributes.

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/rag-pdf-summarization.git
cd rag-pdf-summarization
```

2. Install Dependencies
To install required libraries, use the requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:

langchain
transformers
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
tesseract
PyMuPDF
openai

### Usage:
1. Text Extraction from PDFs
Use the following snippet to extract text from both scanned and digital PDFs
```bash
from pdf_extraction import extract_text

# Extract text from a digitally-created PDF
pdf_path = "sample_digital.pdf"
text = extract_text(pdf_path, ocr=False)

# Extract text from a scanned PDF using OCR
pdf_path_scanned = "sample_scanned.pdf"
text_ocr = extract_text(pdf_path_scanned, ocr=True)

print(text)
print(text_ocr)

```
2. Create Embeddings for Search
```bash
from embedding import create_embeddings

# Create embeddings for the extracted text
documents = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document content."]
embeddings = create_embeddings(documents)

print(embeddings)

```
3. RAG Pipeline
```bash
from rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline

# Initialize the RAG Pipeline
rag_pipeline = RAGPipeline()

# Ask a question
query = "Summarize the document in English."
response = rag_pipeline.answer_query(query, pdf_path="sample_digital.pdf")

print(response)

```
4. Metadata Filtering
```bash
# Add metadata filtering to limit search results by language
response = rag_pipeline.answer_query(
    query="Summarize the document",
    pdf_path="sample_digital.pdf",
    metadata={"language": "English"}
)

print(response)

```
Pipeline Architecture
1. Text Extraction
OCR for Scanned PDFs: Using Tesseract.
PDF Parsing: For digital PDFs, using PyMuPDF (Fitz).
2. Embedding Creation
Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from sentence-transformers is used for generating embeddings.
3. Hybrid Search
Vector Database: FAISS for semantic search.
Keyword Search: Based on extracted metadata.
4. Query Decomposition
Breaks down complex queries into smaller sub-queries for granular results.
5. RAG Pipeline
LLM: Llama2-7B is used for fluent and relevant text generation.
Models and Libraries
Text Extraction:
Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs.
PyMuPDF (Fitz) for digital PDFs.
Embeddings:
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from sentence-transformers.
Language Model:
Llama2-7B for fluent text generation and summarization.
Vector Search:
FAISS for high-performance vector search.
Evaluation
Performance Metrics
Query Relevance: The RAG system returns highly relevant results based on semantic and keyword search.
Latency: Achieved an average latency of 2-3 seconds per query.
Scalability: The pipeline handles large datasets up to 1TB with stable performance.
Results
Accurate text extraction from both scanned and digital PDFs.
Scalable RAG pipeline with support for multilingual documents.
Effective memory retention for chat-like interactions.
Future Improvements
Advanced Document Segmentation: Further refine text chunking for complex documents.
Multilingual Models: Integrate LLMs suited for handling multilingual documents.
Real-time Performance: Continue to optimize for reduced latency in large-scale deployments.
